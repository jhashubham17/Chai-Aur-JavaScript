## JavaScript And Classes

Yes, JavaScript does have a concept of classes, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015. Prior to ES6, JavaScript used prototype-based inheritance, which could be less intuitive for developers coming from languages with class-based inheritance.
With the introduction of classes in ES6, JavaScript provides a more structured and familiar way to define and work with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Classes in JavaScript allow you to define blueprints for objects, create instances of those classes, and use inheritance to establish relationships between classes.
